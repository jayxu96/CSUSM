  This ll1 parser works for non terminals S, A and B
  and terminals 0 and 1

  This does not require $ at the end of the input 

  See rules for the input file.  $ is used to mark end 
  of each line.

  Run my demo program first.  Try 0110, 200, 0110000
  Observe the error messages.
  Then complete ll1.cpp.
