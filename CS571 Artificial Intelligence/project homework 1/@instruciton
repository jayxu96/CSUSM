The following story is from N. Wirth’s (1976) Algorithms + data structures = programs.
I married a widow (let’s call her W) who has a grown-up daughter (call her D). My father (F), 
who visited us quite often, fell in love with my step-daughter and married her. Hence my father
became my son-in-law and my step-daughter became my mother. Some months later, my wife gave 
birth to a son (S1), who became the brother-in-law of my father, as well as my uncle. The wife 
of my father, that is, my step-daughter, also had a son (S2).


Using predicate calculus, create a set of expressions (facts) that represent the situation in 
the above story. Add expressions (rules) defining basic family relationships such as the 
definition of father-in-law and use modus ponens on this system to prove the conclusion that 
“I am my own grandfather.”
